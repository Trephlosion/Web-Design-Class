                <section class="fluff">
                        <aside>Dreamscapes is an open-world game where you can freely move around and partake in any activity you wish. In the story mode, you can do whatever you want to do, from participating in the main story or the side quest, and if you feel like not doing any missions, you can roam around and see what things you can find to make the game more fun for you. It is a unique RPG take; instead of having all quests in one place and everyone following them, they are spread across different areas of the map so that players have a choice as to how they play their character. In the game you can meet up with your friends, travel together, help each other, and even fight against enemies at times! You will never be stuck without anything to do while exploring the world. Dreamscapes has such a large variety of content available to try out in the world of Fiora, whether it is just walking through towns or going into dungeons deep underground. There are many places to explore, but there will always be something new to discover in this fantasy land!  Explore the Wonderful continent of Fiora in the world of your Dreams! Come explore the world of Fiora and learn more about its people. See if you can master its magic, or will you become consumed by it... </aside>

You can get stronger by training against the Demon King’s Dark Legion and doing side quests to unlock special moves to aid in defeating bosses and enemies. Along the way you will gain various skill cards to use when fighting, unlocking new spells and techniques. Are you ready to take the journey forward, player? <br>
