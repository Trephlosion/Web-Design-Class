After defeating him however, he leaves behind his minions known as the Dark Legion. Your job is then to defeat the Dark Legion, which will lead you into completing the final mission to complete the game. Battles are usually fought between two characters (you choose which one) by selecting abilities. These abilities come in three types: Physical Attack, Magic Attack, and Support. </p>

              <figcaption class="descriptrow"> Al is an dark elf who grew up in the Ashlandian Wastes for about 18 years of his life but was cast out for some unknown crime. He had been living in a small, abandoned, makeshift shelter on the outskirts of the Floaria Jungle for a while before the character met him. He has been characterized as a short, green goblin  due to his race's nature and affinity towards poison magic. Al believes himself to be a thief by trade; he has no real formal training when it comes to combat or bladesmanship despite being a skilled tactician. He is also extremely protective over his fellow dark elves after witnessing what humans did to them during their time in the Great Ashlandian War 8000 years ago. Al sets off on a journney alongside you to help stop the Demon Lord from conquering the world. <br> <br> To aid you on your quest, Al joins your party. He is a nimble theif with some magic spells at his disposal to set traps for enemies. His skills are focused around stealth and trickery, using his poison ability to take down foes silently. He can also use a bow and arrow, though he prefers to use his poison darts. He carries a dagger, which he uses to stab foes, or as a melee weapon.</figcaption> </figure>

               <figcaption>Mr. Miracle is a pyromancer from the Ignea Isles, but he's been living in the human world for decades. He's got a natural talent for fire magic and a strong sense of justice. He's very well-known locally as a hero who saved a village from a volcanic eruption. Mr. Miracle uses his power to protect the family he has left on the isles, and he is a little hot headed at times. When the protagonist meets him, Mr. Miracle challenges the protagonist to a duel. After their battle, the protagonist realizes that Mr. Miracle isn't as tough as he seems. Humbled, Mr. Miracle joins the main characters party to aid on his journey as well as to grow stronger on his own. <br> <br> Due to Mr. Miracle's hometown being a caldera of a dormant volcano, he has a very strong fire and earth affinity in magic. This allows him to control and manipulate the earth, such as controlling the flow of lava or even creating small earthquakes. He's also quite skilled at controlling and manipulating wind with his flames. All this makes him an incredibly powerful mage, especially since he's not very experienced. To aid on you journey, Mr. Miracle's powerful explosion-type attacks have a boosted chance of burning enemies caught in the blast.  And if he gets hit by a fire-based attack, his HP will be healed. But don't worry, that's why we're here!</figcaption> </figure>

               <figcaption>The Beast King is a half lion beastman who resides deep withing the depths of his kingdom, The Floaria Jungle. He is well known across the continent of Fiora for his charisma and cheerfulness.  He has a habit of being extremely flamboyant when he speaks, often giving off a cheery, happy-go-lucky vibe. This can sometimes lead to people mistaking his words as simple gibberish. Don't let his actions and vocabulary decieve you --he is also the strongest person on the continent of Fiora, as well as the king of the jungle animals of Floaria Jungle!! His heavy attacks can leave you staggering and can even break through blocking! He aids the main character on his quest by sending his armies to assist in the fights against the Dark Legion.<br> <br>The Beast King also has a special relationship with the Queen of Fiora, as they were childhood friends. After hearing you are aiding her, he will tag along in certain missions throughout the story. The Beast King is a beast type character, so you have to provide an opening for him to get some damage in. His attacks are powerful, but also slow and unrefined. Make sure to take this into account when joining him on the battlefield! He is also aided by his trusty wolf companion named Koma.  Koma is a three legged wolf that can transform and grow massive in size at will. It is unclear if it is actually Koma's body that changes, or if the transformation is only happening to its fur. Koma is very loyal to the Beast King and will be there to protect him from all enemies, even those that are not in the same battle.</figcaption> </figure>

               <figcaption>Queen Durmia is the queen of the kingdom of Fiora, and generally considered one of the most beautiful women on the continent. She is the reason your journey starts in the first place. Durmia also has the ability to read dreams and the future. She is also the top mage in Fiora. Her magical abilities are unmatched by any other mage in the world. In addition, she can also manipulate time. <br> <br> Durmia's history with the player begins when she invites you to visit her castle. You agree and arrive at the castle, only to find that Durmia has been kidnapped by a group of adventurers. They claim they want to make her their queen, but the truth is something else entirely. The adventurers intend to trade her to the Demon King for a large sum of money.  If the Demon King gets Durmia, he will able to rule the world! Aided by your party, the player will encroach on the Demon King's territory, and try to save the queen! Will Queen Durmia be safe? What will happen? Find out by playing the main story!</figcaption> </figure>
                    
                    <figure> <!-- Figure Element 4 --> 
               <figcaption>The Demon King wants Queen Durmia because she has the power to read dreams and the future. He thinks if he can control her, he'll be able to predict the future, and use that knowledge to his advantage. The Demon King is the ruler of the Demon Territorry, which is a country located on the far east side of the continent. His palace is located in the capital city of Vyborg, and he spends most of his time there. His army is huge, and he's managed to conquer the surrounding countries. He is of draconian decent and a direct offspring of the mythical black dragon that appeared 8000 years ago. His powers include flight, the ability to use dark and fire magic, and the ability to use wind magic.<br> <br> The Demon King's goal is to rule the world, and he doesn't care who gets in his way. He is extremely powerful, and he has no qualms about using his power to get what he wants. His army is massive, and he has a great deal of support from the citizens of the surrounding countries. He is a tyrant, and the people hate him. The Demon King wants to rule the world, but he also has a secret goal that may not be so noble.</figcaption> </figure>
                    <figure> <!-- Figure Element 4 --> 
               <figcaption>The Demon King's right hand man and closest disciple is a dark elf named Kresimir. Kresimir has the power to create demons from thin air. He is incredibly powerful, and he can command thousands of demons at once. He is also extremely intelligent, and he is constantly studying and learning new things. Kresimir is also the general commander of the Demon King's army, called The Dark Legion. Kresimir is devoted to helping his king- whatever means necessary. <br> <br>The Demon King's second in command is a human named Volkan. He is a sorcerer with the power to control and manipulate shadows. He is a master of darkness, and he is extremely skilled at controlling shadows. He is an expert at illusion magic, and he can create illusions that are nearly impossible to see through. He is also a master of the dark arts, and he is a very dangerous enemy.</figcaption> </figure>

All those who live here recount how there is always joy in Fiora. But before Fiora was so joyful a millennium-long war ravished the land, creating deep ruins, and opposing beliefs. Below Fiora's surface are ancestral beings who once held all the magical abilities of land. Today, Fiorans are strong believers in magic and dreams, and have made peace with the ancestors below ground. There are many locations in Fiora such as:</p>
